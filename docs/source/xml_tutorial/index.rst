What is XML?
------------

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a flexible, text-based format for storing and transporting data. It is both **human-readable** and **machine-readable**, making it widely used in various applications, including web services, databases, and configuration files.

### **Why Use XML?**
- **Self-Descriptive:** XML allows users to define their own tags and structure.
- **Platform-Independent:** XML is not tied to any specific operating system or software.
- **Data Storage & Transport:** It provides a structured way to exchange data between systems.
- **Readable Format:** Unlike binary formats, XML is easy to read and edit.
- **Standardized:** It follows a set of rules, making it widely accepted in the industry.
